# How do I approach designing software?
 What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? The skills that I have aquired are the ability to add shapes in OpenGL, developted an understanding of how to place shapes in xyz positions, and how to add texture and lighting as needed.
What design process did you follow for your project work?  I read the assignment material, asked the proffessor, and studied the 1-2 example.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?  Well, if I am asked to modify a scene, I will have a understanding of adding shapes, textures, etc.
# How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?  Well, Positioning, adding texture, and lighting effects.
How did iteration factor into your development?  I started to slowly understand what funtions did what, and how to position them within the code.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?  I was able to atleast give a little bit of my scene concept some life.  It felt good to see the itmes on my desk, come to life.  
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?  I will understand the language.  Understanding what the customer wants, allows you to give them just that.  You have to understand the terminilogy.  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?  Well, everything is going digital.  With AI, there are no limitations; and I desperately want to be part of that world.
